  Abstract                 = {We review connections between phase transitions in
 high-dimensional combinatorial geometry and phase
 transitions occurring in modern high-dimensional
 data analysis and signal processing. In data
 analysis, such transitions arise as abrupt breakdown
 of linear model selection, robust data fitting or
 compressed sensing reconstructions, when the
 complexity of the model or the number of outliers
 increases beyond a threshold. In combinatorial
 geometry, these transitions appear as abrupt changes
 in the properties of face counts of convex polytopes
 when the dimensions are varied. The thresholds in
 these very different problems appear in the same
 critical locations after appropriate calibration of
 variables. These thresholds are important in each
 subject area: for linear modelling, they place hard
 limits on the degree to which the now ubiquitous
 high-throughput data analysis can be successful; for
 robustness, they place hard limits on the degree to
 which standard robust fitting methods can tolerate
 outliers before breaking down; for compressed
 sensing, they define the sharp boundary of the
 undersampling/sparsity trade-off curve in
 undersampling theorems. Existing derivations of
 phase transitions in combinatorial geometry assume
 that the underlying matrices have independent and
 identically distributed Gaussian elements. In
 applications, however, it often seems that
 Gaussianity is not required. We conducted an
 extensive computational experiment and formal
 inferential analysis to test the hypothesis that
 these phase transitions are universal across a range
 of underlying matrix ensembles. We ran millions of
 linear programs using random matrices spanning
 several matrix ensembles and problem sizes;
 visually, the empirical phase transitions do not
 depend on the ensemble, and they agree extremely
 well with the asymptotic theory assuming
 Gaussianity. Careful statistical analysis reveals
 discrepancies that can be explained as transient
 terms, decaying with problem size. The experimental
 results are thus consistent with an asymptotic
 large-n universality across matrix ensembles;
 finite-sample universality can be
 rejected. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society},

stepwise

Several function for doing stepwise linear regression in R.

Based on an original function by  Paul A. Rubin which was written for teaching purposes 
(see his comments at http://orinanobworld.blogspot.com.au/2011/02/stepwise-regression-in-r.html).

I have added two other functions, forward.stepwise.Bonferroni() and forward.stepwise.FDR().
which do forward stepwise model selection with respectively a Bonferroni and False Discovery rate stopping rule.
My interest in doing this was to replicate some of the work in 
Donoho, David and Stodden, Victoria. Breakdown point of model selection when the number of variables exceeds the number of observations,
The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings, 2006, pp 1916-1921.

A Matlab library is provided by the authors but I felt more comfortable working in R.

to install the package in R use

library("devtools")

install_github("parsifal9/stepwise-")

To see the plots exploring the breakdown point type
